## R2 Ditu App

<!-- TODO: Update with your hosted app URL -->
The hosted R2 Ditu app showcases the full capabilities of the whiteboard editor. The app's [source code](./excalidraw-app) is part of this repository and features:

- 📡&nbsp;PWA support (works offline).
- 🤼&nbsp;Real-time collaboration.
- 🔒&nbsp;End-to-end encryption.
- 💾&nbsp;Local-first support (autosaves to the browser).
- 🔗&nbsp;Shareable links (export to a readonly link you can share with others).

We'll be adding these features as drop-in plugins for the npm package in the future.

### AI Assistant for Brainstorming

R2 Ditu includes an AI Assistant to help you brainstorm ideas, generate diagrams from text, and get suggestions for your drawings. Access it via the "AI Assistant" option in the main menu. This feature allows you to:

-   **Generate diagrams:** Describe what you want to draw, and the AI will attempt to create it.
-   **Get suggestions:** Select elements on your canvas and ask the AI for improvements or related ideas.
-   **Collaborate with AI:** Work alongside the AI agent in real-time collaborative sessions.

This feature requires a backend service. For local development, ensure the AI backend is running (see development documentation for details).
